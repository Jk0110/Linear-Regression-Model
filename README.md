# Linear-Regression-Model
My first linear regression model used a Real-Life example dataset. Preprocessed the data and built a model
Eliminated the unwanted features
Treated the missing values, here I dropped the rows since it had less than 5% of missing values 
Plotted a distplot for detecting the outliers and handled the outliers using the quantile method
Created dummy variables for the categorical features(drop first is set to true) 
Scaling was done on the independent features and the model was built
The train and test size are in proportion 80:20
There is a room for improvement for this model.
